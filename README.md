# cisc3130 assignment 2


Instructor: Katherine Chuang \

## Objectives

There are two parts to this assignment, each part should be written in their own file. Please try to use the same names.

### Objective 1

Implement a function to check if an input is a palindrome. The input could be of any type - character, number, or objects. If the input has different case, for example Smiles, it should still be considered a palindrome. 

A [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is same forwards as it is backwards (i.e. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0)

**Suggested Implementation:** Use the [Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) interface.

**Sample input:** `["r", "a", "c", "e", "c", "a", "r"]` *Assume only numbers or characters*

**Output:** `boolean` TRUE | FALSE

### Objective 2

Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted singly linked list.
Inputs are sorted, you can assume smallest to largest values.

**Suggested Implementation:** Use the [Queue](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html) interface.

**Sample input:** `[1,3,5]` and `[2,4,5,6]`

**Sample output:** `[1,2,3,4,5,5,6]`
